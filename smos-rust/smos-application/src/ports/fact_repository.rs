//! `FactRepository` port — persistence of the `Fact` aggregate.
//!
//! Seven operations covering the full lifecycle: save, get, list-by-status,
//! semantic search, bulk heat updates, and the cross-namespace session
//! provenance scan used by the finalize trigger when the caller knows only
//! the session id. Implementations are responsible for transactional
//! integrity; the trait surface is intentionally minimal so it can be backed
//! by any vector-aware store.
